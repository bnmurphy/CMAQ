# Lightning NOX Production Updates

**Author/P.O.C.:**, [Daiwen Kang](mailto:kang.daiwen@epa.gov), Computational Exposure Division, U.S. EPA

## Brief Description 

Two major updates for lightning NOX production in the CMAQ 5.2 release: (1) use of hourly NLDN lightning data to directly estimate lightning NOx (LNOx) production, and (2) a new LNOx parameterization based on the model convective rainfall rate (RC – rain convective), which is designed for future forecasts where observed lightning data are not available.

## Significance and Impact

(1) The first major update uses raw NLDN data to produce hourly lightning strikes gridded to the model domain. This data is then used to estimate hourly LNOx production. The old CMAQ method used monthly gridded total lightning strike data, which were then scaled by the modeled precipitation rate, to estimate hourly LNOx. Thus, the use of the hourly (instead of monthly) NLDN data improves the timing/location of LNOx production. A test run has been made with CMAQv5.1 for July 2011 to examine the impacts of this update. The results reveal that the use of hourly NLDN data improves surface ozone bias and error by 0.5-2 ppb. The improvements are most notable over the southeast United States where lightning events are most prevalent. The update presumably will have positive impacts on ozone and other compounds (e.g., NO2) throughout the depth of the troposphere. A future study will evaluate the update more extensively. However, the results so far are very encouraging and confirm that the update is working correctly (in CMAQv5.1). More test cases would be helpful to support these preliminary results.

(2) The new LNOx parameterization is based on the linear (and/or log linear) regression relationship between multi-years’ WRF generated convective rainfall and the observed NLDN lightning strike data. The goal of this parameterization is to be able to realistically estimate LNOx in situations where lightning data are not available (e.g., future forecasts). Preliminary results indicated that the new parameterization matched better with NLDN-derived LNOx than the previous method. A more in-depth description of the new method and more results can be made available in the near future.

One caveat is that this relationship was derived from WRF simulations that all used the Kain-Fritsch convective parameterization. Therefore, the relationship between convective rainfall and observed lightning derived here might not be applicable to other convective schemes (e.g., Grell). Additionally, the derived relationship is only valid over the continental U.S., and is therefore not applicable to other domains.

Gridded NLDN Lightning Strike Data
Hourly data over the conus US 12km domain in IOAPI format (direct input to CMAQ) are available and able to provide data for any other domains if domain description files are provided. Contact Daiwen Kang (kang.daiwen@epa.gov, 919-541-4587) for details.
