There are three formats of the CSN observed data .csv files.  

The number of columns and the column names changes across the time series provided (2001-2014).

As a result the species defintions with the run script for the sitecmp program need to be changed accordingly.

For applications using data from years 2001 - 2009 modify the sample script: run.sitecmp.CSN.2009.and.earlier

For applications using data from 2010 modify the sample script: run.sitecmp.CSN.2010 

For applications using data from years 2011 - 2014 modify the sample script:  run.sitecmp.CSN.2011.and.later
